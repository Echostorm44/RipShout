A ShoutCast Internet Radio Stream Player, Ripper, Best Friend.

  I love listening to Digitally Imported and RadioTunes radio while I'm working but like normal radio, I don't always catch the name of a song that I like and am left with great sadness hoping it comes on again.  RipShout helps with this by recording all the music you hear all day, breaking it up in to nice MP3s with album art (if possible) and artist, album tags so you can play through the songs and find the one that you were rocking out to to buy on iTunes or whatever.
  
  It also fetches fan art and album art and rotates it Zune style thereby making your music listening experience much more awesome. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.
